<p>Last week I realized something: <strong>this is a good time to be a web developer</strong>.</p> 
<p>Why? Well, here are the reasons I have:</p>

<p><strong>Social sites provide free marketing</strong>: assuming you don't wait till you have your entire product done, but have a cool idea and a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/10/designing-coming-soon-pages/">coming soon page</a>, you can get feedback for it <em>for free</em> in sites like facebook and twitter, thus allowing you to get a client base without even having the product done!</p> 
<p><strong>Developing is easier and cheaper</strong>: with free web frameworks like <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails</a> and many others, not only creating robust, reliable and cool web applications is faster (you could release a minimum viable product in less than a month), but also cheaper: they're and compatible with free operating systems.</p> 
<p><strong>Information available via APIs opens a world of possibilities</strong>: Not long ago, some really cool projects couldn't see the light of day because they needed the most valuable resource ever: <strong>content</strong>. Just look at all the information that sites like <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, <a href="http://freebase.com">freebase</a> and <a href="http://delicious.com">delicious</a> have and then think what could <strong>you</strong> do with it in benefit of others; and then realize that <em>it's now possible</em> via their free public APIs: now you can stand on the shoulders of giants, instead of cloning them and falling into oblivion. You don't need to create the next delicious or the next metaweb: you can use them as a base for a really awesome new product!</p> 
<p><strong>Deploying is easier, too</strong>: hosting is getting cheaper and better, solutions like <a href="http://linode.com/">linode</a>(a VPS service), <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">rackspacecloud</a> are affordable, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">google app engine</a> is <strong>free</strong>. So you could have at least a beta version of your app for as little as the <strong><em>ten bucks a year a .com domain costs</em></strong></p> 
<p>So, you don't have to be the only one, only the best; and now you can be the best with the least economical risk, the fastest developing cycle without compromising your revenues.</p> 
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get up and start coding, it's never been easier and cheaper, and it wont last long!</p>
