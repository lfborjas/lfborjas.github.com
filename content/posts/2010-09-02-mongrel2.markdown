Mongrel2, the language agnostic web-server. That sounds rad. So, naturally, I had to install it. I am, at the time of writing, barely reading the chapter three of the [book](http://mongrel2.org/static/book-final.pdf) but managed to go through the installation thanks to the very detailed guide provided there.

But I ran into some (easily fixable) issues, which I'll share for posterity and the sanity of others.

* When installing the dependencies, it complained about how `uuid-dev` was missing. A `sudo apt-get install uuid-dev` fixed that.
* If you're like me and like copy-pasting lines of code that seem to long, and are reading the pdf version of the book, be careful with the '~' character: it will be copied as another one that isn't the /home/user shortcut. This is a preposterous one, I know, but it spew some errors about the sqlite database and stuff that might prove discouraging.
* When trying to `make all install` mongrel2, it complained about not finding some zeromq library. Fixed it by going into the folder where I keep zeromq and running `sudo ldconfig -v`.

So, that's that, I'm off to learn about mongrel2.
