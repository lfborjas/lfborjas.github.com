The last couple of days I've been doing some [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) hacking, and in a serendipitous google search, stumbled upon these two little guys: [itty](http://github.com/toastdriven/itty) and [juno](http://github.com/breily/juno). They look like interesting python microframeworks, take 'em for a spin!
