So, I moved my blog, *again*. In a previous [post](https://about-lfborjas.appspot.com/blog/entry/im-moving-to-tumblr-world/) in my first attempt at blogging I said I was moving to tumblr because it had a social environment and I didn't have time to develop a better blogging engine.

Well, that was bs. Tumblr is *not* for long blog posts and I felt like a bear in a monocycle there. Also, it wasn't very geek of me to use that instead of [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). So, today, I created a [github page](http://pages.github.com/), installed [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and set up to writing posts in [vim](http://www.vim.org/). Now I can look myself in the mirror again.
