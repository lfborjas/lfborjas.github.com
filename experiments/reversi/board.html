                    Reversi is a simple game: in your turn, you must put new pieces in the board
                    but you can only put them in places that would <em>corner (or trap)</em> 
                    your opponents pieces <strong>between</strong>
                    the new piece and one or more of your the existing ones.
                    . When you place a piece, every trapped piece
                    of your opponent <em>flips</em> to your color.
                    The player with most pieces in the end wins.

                This is an experiment on javascript and html5: the board and pieces are drawn with 
                svg (with the amazing <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raph√§el JS</a> library). 
                The javascript code tries to use pragmatic idioms as well as merging
                techniques of the object-oriented
                and the functional paradigms in ways that would make a purist of either shriek. 
                It's <strong>not</strong> intended as an example of good javascript (not even
                of good programming) but as a little note to myself of things I've learned 
                about javascript which made me love it like I love python, and hopefully
                it will make you say "hey, that dude sucks at JS, I'm gonna learn it and code that game
                much better!". You can view the source code of this very page 
                (the script is called <code>game.js</code>) to fathom the sacrilege of the code, or you can 
                check out the <a href="http://git.lfborjas.com/?p=reversi.git;a=summary">git repository</a>
                if you're into that sort of thing.
