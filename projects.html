<h2>My backlog projects</h2>
<p>When I begin working on an idea or do a throwaway project (usually for a talk or a class), I store them in my private git server, because, even though most of them won't ever or for a long time see the light, I like to keep them, as I learn a lot with that kind of projects. So, if you're looking for ideas or just want to see how much I suck at coding, feel free to browse them at <a href="http://git.lfborjas.com">git.lfborjas.com</a> </p>
