<h2>Javascript experiments</h2>

<p>Lately I've gotten into javascript programming beyond simple vanilla stuff, and have learned a lot, like 
how to use it's function based abstraction to build object-oriented programs, or take advantage of
the fact that functions are first-class citizens to program in a more functional style, as well as 
using svg to draw or localstorage to store information.
</p>
<p>
Here I list the things I've written to get the knack of some of these concepts, the source is open and I've added
comments to each, so you can speak your mind
</p>
