<h2>Javascript experiments</h2>

<p>Lately I've gotten into javascript programming beyond simple vanilla stuff, and have learned a lot, like 
how to use it's function based abstraction to build object-oriented programs, or take advantage of
the fact that functions are first-class citizens to program in a more functional style, as well as 
using svg to draw or localstorage to store information.
</p>
<p>
Here I list the things I've written to get the knack of some of these concepts, the source is open and I've added
comments to each, so you can speak your mind
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/experiments/notes/dashboard.html">A localstorage-backed note taking</a></li>
    <li><a href="/experiments/reversi/board.html">An svg-based reversi game</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>My backlog projects</h2>
<p>When I begin working on an idea or do a throwaway project (usually for a talk or a class), I store them in my private git server, because, even though most of them won't ever or for a long time see the light, I like to keep them, as I learn a lot with that kind of projects. So, if you're looking for ideas or just want to see how much I suck at coding, feel free to browse them at <a href="http://git.lfborjas.com">git.lfborjas.com</a> </p>
