## What's here?

~~An abandoned tech blog using Jekyll, mostly, but also a few interesting things:~~

2020 update: this blog is no longer abandoned! But it's also no longer written in Jekyll: I don't work with Ruby anymore, if I can help it. This blog is now built in [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)

### Javascript experiments

I've been working as a backend engineer for the better part of ten years at the time of writing (2018). There was a time, however, where I was one of three full-time engineers in a startup and had to do the majority of the frontend coding. Between that and teaching, I came across a bunch of interesting little concepts I wanted to try out in a language that lent itself to rapid prototyping and experimentation in a visually satisfying way (and that would be conducive to making me more employable, naturally), so I spent my free time writing some freeform Javascript. These days, I would probably write this stuff in Clojure.

One amusing thing to note is that some of these I originally hosted in a private git server that I had completely forgotten about (had it so I wouldn't have to pay Github for private repos, back when $7/month was truly a luxury), and then moved them here to link from my tech blog. I wonder what non JS projects [got lost to the ages in that server](https://github.com/lfborjas/lfborjas.github.com/commit/1cda26b9c3f46e9ac84e979298cce9b171b815d7).

#### Dwemthy's array

Wrote [this little monstrosity](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/dwemthy/dwemthy.html) in JS to teach object oriented Java. Inspired by `_why's` Dwemthy's array, it's a text based adventure of polymorphism and spookiness. Type `start` at the prompt to explore.

#### "Notes"

A [small foray](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/notes/dashboard.html) into proto "reactive" JS and localstorage. Forgive my CSS.

#### Reversi (Othello)

This [html version](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/reversi/board.html) of the lesser known game is not only an inexplicable testament to my fascination with microsoft typefaces back then, or even an exploration of SVG in the then-nascent html5, but mostly an excuse to apply the tenets of functional programming to perhaps a violent extent that strayed a bit from the JS way. Even all these years after, I [read the source](https://github.com/lfborjas/lfborjas.github.com/blob/master/experiments/reversi/game.js) and think to myself "there was a time when I wrote wild code for the sake of wild code, and sometimes it was smart code too; and then I learned ruby and then I had to write production-quality code, and my wildness waned".

### Unity3D Experiments

Following a coursera Unity 3D course, a few little class projects:

* [Box Shooter](http://tech.lfborjas.com/coursera/BoxShooter/index.html)
* [Roller Madness](http://tech.lfborjas.com/coursera/RollerMadness/index.html)
* [Solar System Simulation](http://tech.lfborjas.com/coursera/SolarSystem/index.html)


### Not here, but from the same time in my life

When I taught, I had a bunch of github organizations and projects created therein, which are interesting in the sense that I created them to either supplement my lectures, or as examples for (and sometimes with) my students (mostly in Spanish):

* [Web development with Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/progra4)
* [An introduction to Linux](https://github.com/intro-linux)
* [Web development with Python/Django](https://github.com/desarrollo-web)
* [An introduction to REST APIs](https://github.com/rest-apis)

### Neither here nor there

Honorable mention to my first job in startupland: Escolarea/Class.io. Still around as a company, but when I was there we were trying to build a business around a Django app that allowed teachers to connect with students in a "microblogging" manner. My friend, the other engineer, and I, learned a lot and produced a bunch of open source forks. https://github.com/escolarea-labs
