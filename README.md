## What's here?

An abandoned tech blog using Jekyll, mostly, but also a few interesting things:

### Javascript experiments

I've been working as a backend engineer for the better part of ten years at the time of writing (2018). There was a time, however, where I was one of three engineers in a startup and had to do the majority of the frontend coding. Between that and teaching, I came across a bunch of interesting little concepts I wanted to try out in a language that lent itself to rapid prototyping and experimentation in a visually satisfying way (and that would be conducive to making me more employable, naturally), so I spent my free time writing some freeform Javascript. These days, I would probably write this stuff in Clojure.

One amusing thing to note is that some of these I originally hosted in a private git server that I had completely forgotten about (had it so I wouldn't have to pay Github for private repos, back when $7/month was truly a luxury), and then moved them here to link from my tech blog. I wonder what non JS projects got lost to the ages in that server.

### Dwemthy's array

Wrote [this little monstrosity](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/dwemthy/dwemthy.html) in JS to teach object oriented Java. Inspired by `_why's` Dwemthy's array, it's a text based adventure of polymorphism and spookiness. Type `start` at the prompt to explore.

### "Notes"

A [small foray](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/notes/dashboard.html) into proto "reactive" JS and localstorage. Forgive my CSS.

### Reversi (Othello)

This [html version](http://tech.lfborjas.com/experiments/reversi/board.html) of the lesser known game is not only an inexplicable testament to my fascination with microsoft typefaces back then, or even an exploration of SVG in the then-nascent html5, but mostly an excuse to apply the tenets of functional programming to perhaps a violent extent that strayed a bit from the JS way. Even all these years after, I [read the source](https://github.com/lfborjas/lfborjas.github.com/blob/master/experiments/reversi/game.js) and think to myself "there was a time when I wrote wild code for the sake of wild code, and sometimes it was smart code too; and then I learned ruby and then I had to write production-quality code, and my wildness waned".
